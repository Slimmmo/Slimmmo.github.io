[AdVenture Capitalist](http://store.steampowered.com/app/346900/) calculator to greedily optimize your purchases.
Made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand), [TanStack Tables](https://tanstack.com/table/latest), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Why the update?
I need a new job so I used this to learn React.
