Things needed to implement a new planet or event.

Preferably I just need to run parseGameState.py on a planet's file and it will extract everything.
Events are loaded from a Google Sheet url so if I can get the URL or the file it will be easy.

1. The lifetime earnings required to get the nth (preferably first) angel investor.
  Why do I need this?
    To set angelScale to be able to calculate angel earnings
  e.g. earth has a first angel amount of 44.444 billion, the moon has 367.309 billion, and mars has 111.111 billion

2. The cost of buying the first of each of the businesses.

3. The scale of the cost of each of the businesses.
  e.g. If buying one level costs $1 then buying the next level costs $2.5, then the scale is 2.5

4. The profit made by one cycle of each of the businesses at level 1.

5. The time it takes for one cycle of each business at level 1.

6. The name of each of the businesses.

7. The level that each business starts at.
  This is usually level 1 for the first business and 0 for the rest of them but it's not always that way.

8. The unlocks for each of the businesses. 
  This requires:
    1. The amount required for the unlock.
    2. Which business the unlock effects.
    3. What is the type of effect. e.g. profit multiplication increase, profit speed increase, etc
    4. What is the amount of the effect. e.g. profit multiplication x4 is 4

9. The cash upgrades.
  This has the same requirements for the unlocks, simply replacing amount required for cost.

10. The angel upgrades.
  Same as cash upgrades.

11. The managers.
  Managers are only required if they reduce the cost of buying businesses. If they do then it requires:
  1. The cost.
  2. Which business the manager effects.
  3. The amount of the manager discount.
